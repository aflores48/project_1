    <h2>Andreas Flores</h2>
    <p>Student</p>
    <p>As a high school student I have focused my course load on STEM skills to better prepare myself for my professional career. Including taking 
    rigorous math courses, multiple college level computer science classes, teaching myself python and working with large data bases using Pandas,
    as well as some basic webscraping. My biggest skill is problem solving and thinking critically to not only complete tasks but to do so efficiently.
    I also work well in collarboration with others and find that in scenarios that involve a team I pride myself in beinbg a leader.</p>
